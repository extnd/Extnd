    <h1>What is Ext.nd?</h1>

    <p>The goal of Ext.nd is to provide the Domino web developer with a toolkit/framework to assist in designing and developing browser based applications.<p>

    <p>As a Notes developer, you can rapidly build applications since a lot of the user interface work is done for you through the Notes client. Additionally, access to the Domino objects can be done through the Notes client via LotusScript and Java. For Domino web developers, the default user interface leaves a lot to be desired and there does not exist any JavaScript classes to access the Domino objects through the browser client. This is where Ext.nd can help. Ext.nd will provide Domino web developers UI components and native JavaScript classes to access Domino objects all through a browser client. Building web applications in Domino can then be done as rapidly as Notes based applications.</p>
